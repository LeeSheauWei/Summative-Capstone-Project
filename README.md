# Summative-Capstone-Project (Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellation, Machine Learning Project)

This Project uses MS SQL, Machine Learning with Python and Power BI. The dataset is from Kaggle.  Introduction This dataset contains 119390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including booking that effectively arrived and booking that were cancelled.  Problem Statement Over the years, most bookings in the hotel industry are via Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), such as Booking.com, Hotels.com and Agoda.  One of the reasons OTAs are getting popular and expanding quickly worldwide is that they have introduced “free cancellation policy” as the main selling point in their marketing campaign. With the rising popularity of OTAs, this resulted in higher cancellation rate.  The impact of higher cancellation rate,  hotel management find it harder to accurately forecast,  have non-optimized occupancy, revenue loss. Lowering prices at the eleventh hour also reduces profit margin.
